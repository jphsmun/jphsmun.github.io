    <h1>Model United Nations</h1>
    <p>The Model United Nations (MUN) is a forum run throughout the the goal of understanding the United Nations, where students are taught not only to speak but to inspire. MUN is an activity in which students participate as delegates, delegating the role of diplomats of the countries they represent. Delegates debate about the world issues, promoting peace and the work of the United Nations through cooperation and diplomacy. 
      Discussing and dealing with  issues, as intense as the ‘Belarusian Border Crisis’ or putting intelligence to ‘technological aspects’  which affects  the world community at large, this activity aims to educate participants about current affairs, international events and the United Nations agenda, while at the same time broadening their understanding of  politics, diplomacy, and the need for harmonious coexistence.</p>

    <h1>JPHS MUN</h1>
    <p>Putting their skills of negotiation and discussion to good use, students come up with solutions to counter various problems faced by the world today. Delegates will discuss and debate upon topics of global interest, using the procedures and practices followed in the United Nations.
At JPHS MUN, we hope to maintain the tradition of an academically centered and intellectually enriching experience for all the delegates. Hoping for all delegates not just to take back awards, but an unforgettable experience of learning and debating.</p>

      <h1>Principal's Address</h1>
      <p>
        "MUNning has become extremely popular among students across the globe. It is truly
heartening to see young students discuss such grave issues with so much confidence
and aplomb. I believe that a Model UN conference hones a student’
s talent in public
speaking, and edifies the skills of compromise, diplomacy, and negotiations.
It helps students to develop a healthy interest in world politics and it develops the
leaders of tomorrow. As part of its endeavour to provide a holistic approach to
education, high school and college students engage in intellectual deliberation, as an
exercise to be more productive and develop strong friendships.
Indeed, a Model UN conference enables each student to harness their analytical and
problem-solving skills.
It instils in participants a deep understanding of the workings of our multination
political system as well as ensures the cultivation of students into responsible
citizens of the future who are aware of global concerns, equipped with the knowledge
to take action to ameliorate our world.
As the conference relays the theme
‘Allere Flamam Vertitatis
’ to go along with the changing
spectrums of the working of the world due to COVID-19, I wish that each delegate in
this prestigious conference stands by the belief that adversities can be changed into
opportunities, peaceful protests can accomplish much more than military aggression,
counter the forces of intolerance, advance global citizenship, and forge human
solidarity based on Mahatma Gandhi’
s philosophy of non-violence. <br> <br>
Thank you.<br>
Madhu Maini<br>
Principal<br>
